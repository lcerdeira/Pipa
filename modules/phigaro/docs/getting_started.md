## Getting Started
### Docker, Singularity
You can avoid all the installation and setup process by loading Phigaro in a prebuilt container. Now, Phigaro is available in [Docker](https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro/blob/master/Dockerfile) and [Singularity](https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro/blob/master/Singularity)! 
You can find `Dockerfile` and `Singularity` files for creating images at this repository.
Some useful paths in containers:
```
phigaro: /root/miniconda3/bin/phigaro
config.yml: /root/.phigaro/config.yml
test_data: /test_data
```

---
### Requirements
* **Python**: Python 3+.<br>
*Python 2.7 is available, but it is no longer supported.*
	* `pip` utility is also required (`sudo apt-get install python-pip` on Ubuntu).


* **Prodigal**: Download it from 
[https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal/wiki/installation](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal/wiki/installation) 
and follow the instructions.

* **HMMER**: Download it from [http://hmmer.org/](http://hmmer.org/)

* **locate**: In order to setup Phigaro easier, you need `locate`. 
 	- It is present in the latest Ubuntu distributions, 
but in case you don't have it, install it with `sudo apt-get install locate`.
 	- For MacOS, you may need to add the following softlink `ln -s /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb /usr/local/bin/updated` and `run brew install wget`.

### Installation
##### Via bioconda
```
conda install -c bioconda phigaro
```
##### Via pip
```
pip3 install phigaro --user
```
##### Via conda
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate phigaro_env
```
Where environment.yml can be downloaded form this repository or created manually:
```
name: phigaro_env
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - pip
  - bioconda::prodigal
  - bioconda::hmmer
  - pip:
    - phigaro
```

---
### Setup
Create a config file with:
```
phigaro-setup
```
It may take some time, since you are downloading the databases.

##### Rootless Mode
By default, root permissions are required for the installation. But you can disable it by adding a flag to `phigaro-setup`:
```
phigaro-setup --no-updatedb
```

##### Allpvoghmms Download Problem
If for some reason the downloading of pVOG database failed, you can download these files manually from [our server](http://download.ripcm.com/phigaro/) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JiwFAz1ob7-WGtxQiHK5o9HHhLdvcNOg?usp=sharing). You should store the files at the directory `$HOME/.phigaro/pvog`.


##### Manual Setup
Also, you can manually create/change a `config.yml` file and write the `hmmer`, `prodigal` and `pvogs` paths like it is done in an example below. Other parameters should stay the same for the proper work of Phigaro unless you want to change them on purpose. A `config.yml` file should be placed to `$HOME/.phigaro` folder or you can provide the path to the config file every time you run `phigaro` with the `-c`  or `--config` parameter.

For the `pvogs` you should download all the files to the `pvog` (or any other folder) via the [link](http://download.ripcm.com/phigaro/) or from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JiwFAz1ob7-WGtxQiHK5o9HHhLdvcNOg?usp=sharing) if it wasn't done previously by `phigaro-setup`.

The content of the `config.yml` file could be found in [the repository](https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro/blob/master/config.yml) or can be copied from down here. It is possible that you may need to change the following paths:
<ul>
<li> <code>hmmer: bin </code> </li>
<li> <code>hmmer: pvog_path </code> </li>
<li> <code>prodigal: bin </code> </li>
</ul>

```  
hmmer:
  bin: /usr/local/bin/hmmsearch
  e_value_threshold: 0.00445
  pvog_path: /root/.phigaro/pvog/allpvoghmms
phigaro:
  mean_gc: 0.46354823199323625
  penalty_black: 2.2
  penalty_white: 0.7
  threshold_max_abs: 52.96
  threshold_max_basic: 46.0
  threshold_max_without_gc: 11.42
  threshold_min_abs: 50.32
  threshold_min_basic: 45.39
  threshold_min_without_gc: 11.28
  window_len: 32
prodigal:
  bin: /root/miniconda3/bin/prodigal
```
 
!!! Note 
	If you use Phigaro version 2.1.x or lower (for some reason) you should use `config_old.yml` file, that you can find via [the link](https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro/blob/master/config_old.yml).
 



##### All Options
Moreover, you may want to change a path of a config installation file or reconfigurate your Phigaro by adding special flags:
```
phigaro-setup --help
usage: phigaro-setup [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-p PVOG] [-f] [--no-updatedb]

Phigaro setup helper

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Path to a config.yml, default is
                        /home/polly/.phigaro/config.yml (default:
                        /home/polly/.phigaro/config.yml)
  -p PVOG, --pvog PVOG  pvogs directory, default is /home/polly/.phigaro/pvog
                        (default: /home/polly/.phigaro/pvog)
  -f, --force           Force configuration and rewrite config.yml if exists
                        (default: False)
  --no-updatedb         Do not run sudo updatedb (default: False)
```

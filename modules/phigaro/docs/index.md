## Phigaro
Phigaro is a standalone command-line application that is able to detect prophage regions taking
raw genome and metagenome assemblies as an input. It also produces dynamic annotated “prophage
genome maps” and marks possible transposon insertion spots inside prophages. It is applicable for mining
prophage regions from large metagenomic datasets.
